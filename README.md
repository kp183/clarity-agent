Clarity Agent automates Root Cause Analysis (RCA) by analyzing logs, correlating events, and suggesting safe, context-aware remediation actions. It combines a human-friendly CLI with AWS Bedrock and an MCP-compatible tool server to shorten incident resolution from hours to minutes.

## ‚ú® **Key Capabilities: A Three-Agent AI System**

### üîç **1. Analyst Agent (Reactive Incident Analysis)**
-   **AI-Powered RCA**: Connects to **AWS Bedrock (Amazon Titan)** for high-confidence root cause analysis.
-   **Multi-Format Parsing**: Ingests and consolidates JSON, CSV, and plain text logs into a single timeline.
-   **Intelligent Remediation**: Intelligently selects the correct `kubectl` command (e.g., `restart` vs. `rollback`) by analyzing the AI's findings and calling a standards-compliant **MCP server**.

### üõ°Ô∏è **2. Sentinel Agent (Proactive Monitoring)**
-   **Continuous Monitoring**: Runs as a background service, automatically scanning log files for negative trends.
-   **Predictive Alerts**: Uses AI to generate high-severity warnings (e.g., "high error rate detected") *before* an incident occurs.
-   **Rich Dashboard**: Displays a professional monitoring table in the console, showing scan status in real-time.

### ü§ñ **3. Co-Pilot Agent (Interactive Investigation)**
